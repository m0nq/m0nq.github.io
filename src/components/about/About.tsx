                        I started my career at <a href="https://www.industriallogic.com/" target="_blank">Industrial
                        Logic</a>, where I learned the ropes of Extreme Programming and how to build software that's
                        both robust and easy to maintain. Working with <a href="https://www.ford.com/" target="_blank">Ford
                        Motors</a> I had the opportunity to collaborate across multiple teams, contributing to the
                        development of a high-functioning, user-focused website that streamlined the process for users
                        to find the right car configuration, making it a seamless experience for customers.

                        At <a href="https://reflexion.com/" target="_blank">RefleXion Medical</a>, I dedicated several
                        years to creating
                        an intuitive Electron based user interface that allowed doctors to interact seamlessly with
                        cutting-edge cancer treatment and research technology. This experience deepened my
                        appreciation for the transformative power of technology in the medical field.

                        Throughout my career, I've been driven by a passion for the creative process and its
                        ability to inspire both intellectual and emotional growth. I firmly believe that
                        everyone has the innate ability to create something unique, given the right tools and
                        opportunities. Web technology tools, in particular, offer a powerful canvas for bringing
                        innovative ideas to life.

                        My diverse experiences have equipped me with a well-rounded skillset, enabling me to
                        tackle projects with a user-centric approach, attention to detail, and a commitment to
                        delivering exceptional results.

                        I'm open to work that utilizes my expertise of JavaScript and React frameworks like Next.js and
                        Gatsby, especially projects for small businesses and non-profits, industries that help creatives
                        promote and express themselves, as well as green tech offering climate focused solutions.
